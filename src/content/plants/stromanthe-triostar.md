The Stromanthe Triostar (*Stromanthe sanguinea* 'Triostar') is a stunning tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. Known for its vibrant tricolored foliage featuring green, pink, burgundy, and cream hues, this plant belongs to the prayer plant family (Marantaceae).

## Light

The Triostar thrives in bright indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch its beautiful leaves. A north or east-facing window works best.

## Water

Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Use non-chlorinated water (like filtered or distilled water) for best results.

## Temperature & Humidity

This tropical plant prefers temperatures between 18-27°C (65-80°F). Below 15°C (60°F) can induce dormancy. It loves high humidity—bathrooms are an ideal spot. Mist regularly or use a humidifier.

## Soil

Use well-draining soil with peat moss, perlite, and coarse sand to prevent root rot.

## Non-toxic

Good news for pet owners—the Stromanthe Triostar is non-toxic to cats and dogs.
