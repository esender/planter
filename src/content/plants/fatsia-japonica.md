Fatsia japonica (Japanese aralia) is an evergreen shrub in the Araliaceae family, native to Japan and South Korea. It is grown for its large, glossy, hand-shaped leaves and clusters of creamy white flowers in autumn, followed by black berries.

## Light

Give Fatsia japonica medium to bright indirect light indoors. It tolerates lower light, but growth is slower and leggier. Place it near an east-facing window or a few feet back from a brighter south or west window so harsh direct sun does not scorch the leaves.

## Water

Water when the top 2-3 cm of soil is dry, which is often about weekly in active growth. Keep the mix lightly and evenly moist, but never soggy. Drooping, crisp leaf edges can indicate underwatering, while persistent yellowing and soft stems usually indicate overwatering.

## Temperature & Humidity

Fatsia japonica prefers about 15-27°C (59-80°F). Protect it from cold drafts and prolonged temperatures below 10°C (50°F). It does best with medium to higher humidity, so avoid placing it near heating vents and use a pebble tray or humidifier if indoor air is very dry.

## Soil

Use a loose, well-draining potting mix that still holds some moisture, such as houseplant compost amended with perlite and fine bark. The goal is steady moisture with enough airflow around roots to prevent rot.

## Toxicity

Toxicity guidance is mixed across references, and RHS notes the ornamental fruit should not be eaten. Treat Fatsia japonica as a caution plant around pets and children and prevent ingestion of leaves or berries.
