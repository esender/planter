The Parlor Palm (*Chamaedorea elegans*), also known as the Neanthe Bella Palm or Good Luck Palm, is a classic houseplant that has graced indoor spaces since Victorian times. Native to the rainforests of Southern Mexico and Guatemala, this compact palm features elegant, feathery fronds on slender cane-like stems, reaching 60-120cm (2-4 feet) indoors.

## Light

Thrives in low to medium indirect light. The Parlor Palm is remarkably tolerant of shade and will cope in light shade, making it perfect for north-facing windows or offices with limited natural light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.

## Water

Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry—typically weekly in summer and every 10-14 days in winter. Yellowing fronds indicate overwatering, while brown leaf tips suggest the air is too dry.

## Temperature & Humidity

Prefers temperatures between 10-27°C (50-80°F). It tolerates average home humidity but appreciates occasional misting or a pebble tray, especially during winter when indoor air tends to be drier. Avoid temperatures below 10°C (50°F).

## Soil

Use a well-draining potting mix with added perlite or sand to prevent root rot. A standard peat-based potting soil works well.

## Non-toxic

Excellent news for pet owners—the Parlor Palm is non-toxic to both cats and dogs according to the ASPCA.
