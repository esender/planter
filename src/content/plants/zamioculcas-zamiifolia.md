The ZZ Plant (*Zamioculcas zamiifolia*), also known as Zanzibar Gem or Eternity Plant, is renowned as one of the most forgiving and low-maintenance houseplants available. Native to eastern Africa, this tropical perennial stores water in thick rhizomes, allowing it to survive extended periods of drought. Its glossy, dark green leaves grow on upright stems, creating an attractive architectural presence.

## Light

Tolerates extremely low light conditions, making it ideal for offices and dim corners. Thrives in low to bright indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch and fade the leaves.

## Water

Allow soil to dry out completely between waterings. Can go weeks or even months without water thanks to its water-storing rhizomes. Overwatering is the primary cause of death—yellow leaves indicate too much water.

## Temperature & Humidity

Prefers temperatures between 15-27°C (60-80°F). Avoid temperatures below 10°C (45°F) and cold drafts. Adapts well to average household humidity levels.

## Soil

Use a well-draining potting mix. Standard houseplant soil works well if it drains freely. Adding perlite or sand improves drainage.

## Toxicity

Toxic to cats, dogs, and humans if ingested. Contains calcium oxalate crystals that cause oral irritation. Keep out of reach of pets and children.
