## Quick Care

- **Water**: Keep soil consistently moist but not soggy
- **Light**: Bright indirect light, tolerates lower light
- **Humidity**: High (60%+), mist regularly
- **Temperature**: 65-80°F (18-27°C)

## Detailed Guide

### Watering

Calatheas are humidity-loving plants that need consistent moisture. Water when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. Use filtered or distilled water if possible—calatheas are sensitive to chemicals in tap water and may develop brown leaf edges.

### Light

These tropical plants prefer bright, indirect light. Too much direct sun will scorch their beautiful leaves, while too little light can cause the vibrant patterns to fade. They tolerate lower light conditions better than many other houseplants.

### Humidity

Calatheas thrive in high humidity (60% or more). Brown leaf edges and curling are common signs of low humidity. Group with other plants, use a pebble tray, or mist regularly to increase humidity. Bathrooms and kitchens are ideal spots.

### Unique Feature

Calatheas are called "prayer plants" because their leaves fold up at night like hands in prayer. This movement is called nyctinasty and is completely normal.

### Common Issues

- **Brown leaf edges**: Usually caused by low humidity or tap water chemicals
- **Yellow leaves**: Often overwatering—let soil dry slightly more
- **Curling leaves**: Indicates the plant needs more water or humidity
- **Faded patterns**: Not enough light

### Pet Safety

Good news for pet owners—calatheas are non-toxic and safe for cats and dogs.
