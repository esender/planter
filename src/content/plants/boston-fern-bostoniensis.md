Boston Fern 'Bostoniensis' (*Nephrolepis exaltata* 'Bostoniensis') is a classic tropical fern in the sword fern group, grown for its soft, arching green fronds and lush form. This cultivar is widely grown indoors and is associated with humid tropical habitats across the Americas, Africa, and Polynesia.

## Light

Place it in medium to bright indirect light. An east-facing window or a few feet back from a bright south or west window works well. Avoid harsh direct sun, which can scorch fronds, but avoid very deep shade that causes thin, sparse growth.

## Water

Keep the mix evenly moist, watering when the top 1-2 cm of soil feels just slightly dry. In active growth this is often about weekly, with less frequent watering in cooler months. Pale or crispy fronds usually indicate underwatering, while limp yellowing fronds and a sour potting mix can indicate overwatering.

## Temperature & Humidity

Boston fern grows best around 18-24°C (65-75°F), and should be protected from temperatures below 10°C (50°F). It prefers high humidity, ideally 60% or higher, so it performs best near a humidifier, on a pebble tray, or in naturally humid rooms.

## Soil

Use a loose, moisture-retentive but well-draining mix: peat or coco coir with perlite and a little compost or fine bark. The goal is steady moisture with enough air around roots to prevent rot.

## Toxicity

This plant is considered non-toxic to cats and dogs and is generally a pet-safe choice for indoor spaces.
