## Quick Care

- **Water**: Let soil dry between waterings
- **Light**: Bright indirect light
- **Humidity**: Prefers 60%+ humidity
- **Temperature**: 18-30°C (65-85°F)

## Detailed Guide

### Watering

Water your Monstera when the top 2 inches of soil feel dry. In summer, this might be weekly; in winter, every 10-14 days. Overwatering leads to yellow leaves.

### Light

Monstera thrives in bright, indirect light. Direct sun can burn the leaves, while too little light results in smaller leaves without fenestrations.

### Growth

These plants can grow quite large (up to 8 feet indoors). Provide a moss pole for support as they climb. Rotate regularly for even growth.

### Common Issues

- **Yellow leaves**: Usually overwatering
- **Brown edges**: Low humidity
- **No fenestrations**: Not enough light
